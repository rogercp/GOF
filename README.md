# Conways Game of Life

You can find the deployed project at https://cranky-tereshkova-ba2534.netlify.app/.

<br>

## Project Overview

Application where The Game of Life (or simply Life) is not a game in the conventional sense. There are no players, and no winning or losing. Once the "pieces" are placed in the starting position, the rules determine everything that happens later. Nevertheless, Life is full of surprises! In most cases, it is impossible to look at a starting position (or pattern) and see what will happen in the future. The only way to find out is to follow the rules of the game.


## Tech Stack
